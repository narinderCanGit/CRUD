# **Overview**
The Node.js CRUD application is built using the Express.js framework, which is a popular web application framework for Node.js. The application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a database, including creating new records, retrieving existing records, updating records, and deleting records. It uses a RESTful API approach for handling HTTP requests and responses.

# **Prerequisites**
Before running the Node.js CRUD application, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

Node.js: You need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).

Express.js: Express.js is a dependency of this application, and it needs to be installed. You can install it using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: npm install express

Database: You need to have a database installed and running, such as MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL, as this application will perform CRUD operations on the database.

# **Setup**
Follow these steps to set up and run the Node.js CRUD application:

Clone or download the application code from the repository.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the application.

Install the application dependencies using npm by running the following command: npm install

Configure the database connection settings in the application. You can do this by modifying the configuration file (e.g., config.js or .env) to provide the necessary details, such as database host, port, username, password, and database name.

Run the application using Node.js by running the following command: node app.js or npm start. This will start the Node.js server and make the application accessible at the specified port.

Open a web browser or use a REST client (e.g., Postman) to access the API endpoints exposed by the application for performing CRUD operations on the database.

# **API Endpoints**
The Node.js CRUD application exposes the following API endpoints for performing CRUD operations on the database:

GET /aliens Retrieves all records from the database.<br>
GET /aliens/:id Retrieves a record with the specified ID from the database.<br>
POST /aliens Creates a new record in the database.<br>
PATCH /aliens/:id Updates a record with the specified ID in the database.<br>
DELETE /aliens/:id Deletes a record with the specified ID from the database.<br>
You can use these endpoints to perform CRUD operations on the records stored in the database.

# **Conclusion**
This README file provides an overview of a Node.js CRUD application and its setup instructions. It also describes the API endpoints exposed by the application for performing CRUD operations on a database. You can follow these instructions to set up and run the application, and use the API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on the database records.
